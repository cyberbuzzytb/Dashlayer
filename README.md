## ✨ What is Dashlayer?

Dashlayer is a **desktop makeover layer** — not an OS, not a launcher, not a productivity app.
It hides clutter and replaces it with a beautiful, futuristic dashboard featuring:

* 🕒 **Live Time & Date**
* 🌍 **Auto Weather Fetching**
* 🎙️ **Microphone Level Visualization**
* 🧊 **Glassmorphism UI**
* 🎞️ **Smooth Transitions**

Designed to give your desktop a clean, premium look in one click.
